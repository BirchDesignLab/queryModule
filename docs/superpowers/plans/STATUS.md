# Status

Master grid for Query Module 2.0. Process: `2026-09-25-implementation-master-plan.md` (sections 5 to 7).
Read at session start. Update at session end, and in any task PR that changes a cell. Each track edits only its own column.

## Legend

- Status words: `planned` | `active` | `done` | `blocked` (name the blocking issue). `next` marks the phase to start first.
- Plan: a link once the phase plan exists; until then its future file name in code text. `<date>` is ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`, the day the plan is written.
- `issues`: GitHub issue filter for that cell (milestone + phase label + track label). Gate `all`: every issue in the phase.
- `n/a`: no cell in the spec 12 grid. Track D starts at M4.
- P0 is one session: its Track A, Track B and Core cells share one plan.

## Handoff notes

Overwrite your track's note at pause using the seven-line format in the master plan 7.1 and link the track's latest handoff file in [docs/handoffs/](../../handoffs/) (CLAUDE.md, "Where records go"); clear it on resume.

### Track A

- Issue: #593 (docs), #606 (release note, gate, promote), #615 (brief and documentation refresh)
- Branch / PR: `docs/m2-overview-pdf` (overview PDF refresh, Refs #615); AW1 #611, AW2 #618, AW3 #621, AW4a #646, AW4b #655 merged
- Last green: main 66a35d2 (demo re-walk fixes #675); `pnpm verify` green on the branch
- Next step: the developer merges the overview PDF PR, then promotes (`promote.yml` with the merge sha, no milestone tag) and runs `bash scripts/ops/smoke.sh https://querymodule.birchdesignlab.com` on the host (output on #606)
- Blocked by: none
- Latest handoff: [10-17-26-m2-debt-3.md](../../handoffs/10-17-26-m2-debt-3.md) (DEBT-3, #642 closed via #695 #696 #697; next: #698 visual comparison)
- Notes: manager "M2 Manager 4" (its push approvals count as the developer's for Track A); open follow-ups #574, #572, #558, #610, #620, #622, #623, #645, #647.

### Track B

- Issue: none open; M2 P0.5 Track B closed (Tasks 1 to 8, #548 to #556)
- Branch / PR: none; BW0 #566, BW2 #568 #571 #577, BW3 #570 #579 merged
- Last green: `pnpm verify` and CI on main 3e85c2b (P0.5 promoted)
- Next step: M2 P1 Track B plan (`2026-10-07-m2-track-b-p1.md`), BW1 design and CW core first; #572, #576 (client half), #565 (Try a match, built in P1 per D-M2P1-4), #586, #587 folded in
- Blocked by: none
- Latest handoff: [10-17-26-m2-debt-1.md](../../handoffs/10-17-26-m2-debt-1.md) (DEBT-1, #690: PR-1 #693 merged, PR-2 change-password in one transaction; next: DEBT-2 and M2 P2 planning in fresh sessions)
- Notes: no local B session; the cloud sessions are done.
