# Status

Master grid for Query Module 2.0. Process: `2026-09-25-implementation-master-plan.md` (sections 5 to 7).
Read at session start. Update at session end, and in any task PR that changes a cell. Each track edits only its own column.

## Legend

- Status words: `planned` | `active` | `done` | `blocked` (name the blocking issue). `next` marks the phase to start first.
- Plan: a link once the phase plan exists; until then its future file name in code text. `<date>` is ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`, the day the plan is written.
- `issues`: GitHub issue filter for that cell (milestone + phase label + track label). Gate `all`: every issue in the phase.
- `n/a`: no cell in the spec 12 grid. Track D starts at M4.
- P0 is one session: its Track A, Track B and Core cells share one plan.
