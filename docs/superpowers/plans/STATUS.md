# Status

Master grid for Query Module 2.0. Process: `2026-09-25-implementation-master-plan.md` (sections 5 to 7).
Read at session start. Update at session end, and in any task PR that changes a cell. Each track edits only its own column.

## Legend

- Status words: `planned` | `active` | `done` | `blocked` (name the blocking issue). `next` marks the phase to start first.
- Plan: a link once the phase plan exists; until then its future file name in code text. `<date>` is ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`, the day the plan is written.
- `issues`: GitHub issue filter for that cell (milestone + phase label + track label). Gate `all`: every issue in the phase.
- `n/a`: no cell in the spec 12 grid. Track D starts at M4.
- P0 is one session: its Track A, Track B and Core cells share one plan.

## Handoff notes

Overwrite your track's note at pause using the seven-line format in the master plan 7.1; clear it on resume.

### Track A

- Issue: #117 Better Auth with session limits and __Host- cookie (Task 14)
- Branch / PR: none; A3 starts on feat/a-p1-wave-3 from main (Tasks 14 to 17, #117 to #120)
- Last green: `pnpm verify` at 10d90c0 on main (1259 tests)
- Next step: "### Task 14: Better Auth with session limits and __Host- cookie (S) (#117)", "- [ ] **Step 1: Write the test helpers.**"; then A3 T14 to T17, A4 T18 to T23 and the #139 route half, A5 T24 to T28, A6 T29 to T35 and T37
- Blocked by: none (A-offload T12 and T13 merged in #188)
- Local-only state: none (Linux laptop: node and pnpm symlinked in /usr/local/bin for workflow agents)
- Notes: T15 adds principal: Principal to AppEnv.Variables in http/types.ts; T14 disables Better Auth telemetry and shows its adapter makes no plain-db call inside a transaction (T6 design); follow-ups #189 and #195 open; Track B waits on #120, #121, #122, #132, #139

### Track B

- Issue: none active; B5 (#202) and B6 (#204) merged, so Tasks 20 to 26 are done
- Branch / PR: none
- Last green: `pnpm verify` at 16a901e on feat/b-p1-wave-6 (1313 tests pass); on Windows only the known packages/api EPERM teardown fails (A2 test helper), accepted, fix in OFFLOAD's PR
- Next step: "### Task 19: Client: preferences sync with `/api/v1/me/preferences` (#159)" once #139's route lands (Linux A4); then "### Task 27: Web: M0 Playwright suite (#167)" once #120, #121, #122, #132 land
- Blocked by: #139 route (A4) for Task 19; #120, #121, #122, #132 for Task 27
- Local-only state: none
- Notes: Task 27 carries B4 and B5 carry-forwards in #167 comments; Task 26 Step 26.7 runs with Track A's web serving; follow-ups #66 (WS half needs the M2 WS client) and #178 (gate tsconfig chore, rides a later B wave PR before M4) stay parked while idle
